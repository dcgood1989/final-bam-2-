## Rails Assessment Two

### Getting Started

-  Fork and clone this repository.
-  Create your database and get started by running `rspec`

### Overview

The specs in this repository walk through implementing user authentication as a refactored version of the previous assessment, in which Magazines and Editions are separate entities. There are both feature and model specs, and the recommended order to complete these in are as follows:

-  User Model
-  User feature spec
-  Magazine Model
-  Edition Model
-  Magazine feature spec

You will know you are complete with this assessment when the entirety of the test suite is passing and there aren't any unnecessarily hard-coded values. This application is designed to root to the magazines index page.
